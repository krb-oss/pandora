# Pandora

> [Sudoku] Solver.

## Introduction

A toy solver which generates solutions for the following board configurations:

* 4x4 board with 2x2 regions
* 9x9 board with 3x3 regions

For simplicity no other types of board are supported!

## Build

Use [Docker] to build a container, then proceed to the next step.

```bash
docker build --tag=krb-oss/pandora .
```

## Getting Started

The Sudoku board state is read from `stdin`, the solver expects a 2D grid of
numbers in a square, where blank spots are represented by `.` (dots). For
example inputs, please see the `examples/` directory. Whitespace is ignored
when reading in the initial board.

```bash
cat examples/9x9example_1.txt | docker run --rm -i krb-oss/pandora
```
